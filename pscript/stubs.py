class RawJS:
    """An object to wrap verbatim code to be included in the generated
    JavaScript. This serves a number of purposes:

    * Using code in PScript that is not valid Python syntax, like regular
      expressions or the jQuery object ``$``.
    * Write high performance code that avoids Pythonic features like operator
      overloading.
    * In Flexx's module system it can be used to create a stub variable in
      Python that *does* have a value in JS. This value can imported in other
      modules, leading to a shared value also in JS.

    PScript does not verify the syntax of the code, so write carefully!
    To allow the features in the 3d point, this object has a magic touch:
    the ``__module__`` attribute of an instance refers to the module in which it
    was instantiated, and if it's a global, its defining name can be obtained.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: py

        # Syntax not usable in Py
        myre = RawJS('/ab+c/')

        # Code that should only execute on JS
        foo = RawJS('require("some.module")')

        # Performance
        def bar(n):
            res = []
            RawJS('''
                for (var i=0; i<n; i++) {
                    if (is_ok_num(i)) {
                        res.push(i);
